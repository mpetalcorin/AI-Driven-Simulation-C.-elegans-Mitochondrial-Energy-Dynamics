# AI-Driven Simulation *C.elegans* Mitochondrial Energy-Dynamics
A proof-of-concept platform for AI-guided phenotyping of synthetic mitochondrial genomes using multi-omics data.

*Author: Mark I.R. Petalcorin*

# Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-driven, high-throughput phenotyping platform for evaluating synthetic mitochondrial genome designs in the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans*.
It integrates multi-omics data, machine learning, and data visualization to simulate how hundreds of synthetic genomes impact:\
	•	Energy production\
	•	Oxidative stress\
	•	Oxygen consumption\
	•	Mitochondrial stability\
	•	Lifespan outcomes\
This proof-of-concept represents the TEST phase of the **Design → Build → Test → Learn (DBTL) cycle**, showing how AI can predict, score, and prioritize mitochondrial genome designs before wet-lab validation.

# Key Features
	•	AI-Guided Phenotyping: Uses synthetic data + machine learning to evaluate hundreds of designs at once.
	•	Multi-Omics Integration: Includes simulated ATP, ROS, oxygen consumption, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lifespan metrics.
	•	Reviewer-Friendly Dashboard: Intuitive, publication-ready plots highlighting key biological trade-offs.
	•	Automated Performance Ranking: AI-driven scoring system prioritizes the most promising synthetic designs.
	•	Exportable Results: Saves top-performing mitochondrial genome candidates for further experimental testing.

# Simulation Workflow
This platform mimics how a high-throughput, robotics-enabled phenotyping lab would test synthetic mitochondrial genomes in *C. elegans*.

**1. Data Simulation**\
Generates a virtual dataset of 300–500 synthetic mitochondrial genome designs, including:\
	•	ATP production (energy)\
	•	ROS accumulation (oxidative stress)\
	•	Oxygen consumption rate\
	•	Mitochondrial membrane potential\
	•	Lifespan index\
	•	Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles

**2. AI Performance Scoring**\
Assigns each synthetic design a Performance Score based on biological relevance:\
	•	Rewards: High ATP, high oxygen efficiency, stable membrane potential, long lifespan\
	•	Penalizes: High ROS and poor metabolic efficiency\
	•	Produces a ranked list of the best candidates

**3. Visualization Dashboard**\
A dashboard is generated to visualize outcomes:\
A. Top Performing Designs: Bar chart ranking the top 15–20 mitochondrial genomes.\
B. Multi-Omics Heatmap: Correlation matrix showing relationships between ATP, ROS, OCR, and lifespan.\
C. Energy vs Stress Trade-Off: Scatterplot showing how ATP and ROS balance affects design success.\
D. ROS vs Lifespan: Visualizes how oxidative stress influences organismal longevity.\
E. Violin Plot of Top vs Low Performers: Compares ATP production across successful vs poor designs.

**4. Exporting Results**
The Top 20 synthetic mitochondrial genome designs are automatically exported for downstream use:\
*C_elegans_Top_Synthetic_Mitochondrial_Designs.csv*\
This file is ready for:\
	•	AI re-training\
	•	Robotic phenotyping\
	•	Wet-lab validation

# Why *C. elegans*?
